# matlabFilters

Various filters developed in Matlab. More here later.

## Directories
- **Data**: Holds data files and workspaces to perform tests on the filters. 
- **Drivers**: Holds the actual testing scripts. 
- **Filters**: Holds all implemented filters along with those still in development. 
- **ModelFuncs**: Holds all the user-defined models that are used to test the filters.
- **OtherFuncs**: Holds any other supplemental functions needed by the filters or test drivers. May be scrapped/changed later on.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With
