# TODO List:

## Unfinished
1. Revisit input descriptions - give ranges by types
2. Finish iESRIF, review iEKF
3. Figure out eta_nukp1 for PF and RegPF 
4. Review PF and RegPF - why does it take so many particles to get a good estimate?
5. build more tests. Monte Carlo tests? Inputs/options tests? One driver for each filter comparing 1step and batch. Large Driver runs combos of them
6. Write subclass descriptions
7. Create function to convert measurement eqns to discrete time?
8. Gaussian Mixture or other filters?
9. Create single-step filter classes
10. Work on smoother classes
11. Finish and organize filter functions
12. Finish all MATLAB assignments and organize them. Delete old assignment directories
13. Write a 'tutorial' and finish the Github README
13. Convert to Python?

## Finished
1. Object-oriented classes for filters
2. Standardize inputs and outputs
3. Create basic drivers for testing
4. Add consistency output variables
5. Reorganize directories **Revisit Later**
6. Write single-step filter abstract class
